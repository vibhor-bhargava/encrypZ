# encrypZ
This is a basic GUI application through which text can be decrypted and encrypted.
It has been created using Python's Tkinter (for front-end) and base64 (for back-end) libraries.

For either encryption and decryption,
we enter our input text in the first input field,
enter the key for manipulating the input message in the 2nd field,
enter the mode (e for encode, d for decode) in the 3rd field, and then click the Result button.
And voila, the result is displayed in the 4th field.

The Reset button resets all the fields to blank, and Exit button exits the program.
